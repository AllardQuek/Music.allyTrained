# Messenger API integration example
# We assume you have:
# * a Wit.ai bot setup (https://wit.ai/docs/quickstart)
# * a Messenger Platform setup (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart)
# You need to `pip install the following dependencies: requests, bottle.
#
# 1. pip install requests bottle
# 2. You can run this example on a cloud service provider like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform or AWS.
#    Note that webhooks must have a valid SSL certificate, signed by a certificate authority and won't work on your localhost.
# 3. Set your environment variables e.g. WIT_TOKEN=your_wit_token
#                                        FB_PAGE_TOKEN=your_page_token
#                                        FB_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_verify_token
# 4. Run your server e.g. python examples/messenger.py {PORT}
# 5. Subscribe your page to the Webhooks using verify_token and `https://<your_host>/webhook` as callback URL.
# 6. Talk to your bot on Messenger!
