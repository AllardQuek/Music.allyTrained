## Inspiration
A problem we've seen many beginner music students have constantly is finding the motivation to dive into the nitty-gritty details of music. 
Many of these students find topics such as intervals, chords and progressions a bore compared to the myriad of distractions online, 
and so we thought: Why not stop trying to _fight_ these distractions and try to _integrate_ with them instead? Wouldn't it be great to have a musical companion bot which music students (and anyone who's interested) could ask their questions and even get a dose of inspiration to love music? 
Thus, Music.ally Trained was born 😊


## Features
Music.ally Trained is a bot which provides a quick and user-friendly way to get started with the basics of music theory and to discover new music! Here's what it can do currently:
1. Return an interval given 2 notes
2. Return the notes in a chord given the chord's name
3. Return songs which include a specified chord progression
4. Return a random song from Spotify
5. Return a musical joke
6. Return a list of top hits by a given artist.
7. Jukebox - helps you pick a random song for your next karaoke session!

## How we built it
Music.ally Trained is built in Python, using a Bottle app deployed on Heroku. To help our bot achieve musical intelligence, we employed the use of the Mingus library and integrated the Spotify and Hooktheory APIs into our app.

## What's next?
We would love to expand on the functionality provided by Music.ally Trained! Here are some ideas we have:
- Implement Messenger's Private Replies function to allow users to receive links to useful musical resources so that they can further expand their knowledge, given that there are limitations to almost any bot's capabilities. 
Our Facebook page is new and has neither any useful posts nor users, but we think this would be a nice feature to have. 
- Broaden the range of music theory questions users may ask which could be relatively easily accomplished as the library we chose, Mingus, offers many useful functions for learning about music. 
- Tap on Natural Language Processing to improve our bot's persona to be even more light-hearted and engaging, so that we can sustain the attention of our users.
- Improve our bot's intelligence through more rigorous training such that it will better handle misspellings and provide users a better experience overall.
